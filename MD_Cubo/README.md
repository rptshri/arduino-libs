The MD_Cubo library implements methods that allow the software elements of LED cubes to be easily implemented, allowing the programmer to use the LED matrix as a pixel device addressable through XYZ cartesian coordinates, displaying graphics elements much like any other pixel addressable display.

The library implements functions that allow LED cubes to be abstracted in software so that underlying hardware changes do not affect the definition and structure of the controlling code.

Library currently comes with working code for 2 4x4x4 cubes and the jolliCube 8x8x8 cube.

## Version 1.1 Update - Feb 2016
* Added jolliCube - first 8x8 cube
* Reorganised library
